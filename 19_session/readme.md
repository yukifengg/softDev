DISCO:
- sessions works like a dictionary
- Can have separate functions with same route
- `b` before a string means it is a byte literal
- `KeyError` isn't raised if you put `None` as a 2nd argument in `session.pop()`

QCC:
- Is there a better way to create a logout button other than making an HTML form and using the submit button?
