from this line? (log your prediction before you pull the trigger...)

Q1: Can all of your teammates confidently predict the URL to use to load this page?
A1: Yes.. We can. http://127.0.0.1:5000/my_foist_template

Q2: What is the significance of each argument? Simplest, most concise answer best.
A2: 
'model_tmplt.html' refers to the html file being run.           'foo="fooooo"' makes the title of the website fooooo. 'collection="coll" makes coll the iterable list.
