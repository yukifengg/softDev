            <h1 id="Intro to Sass"> Intro to Sass </h1>
            <p>
            Sass has features that don't exist in CSS yet like nesting, mixins, inheritance, and other nifty goodies that help you write robust, maintainable CSS.
            </p>
            <h2>Two Syntaxes</h2>
            <!--The SCSS syntax (.scss) is used most commonly. 
                It's a superset of CSS, which means all valid CSS is also valid SCSS. 
                The indented syntax (.sass) is more unusual: it uses indentation rather than curly braces to nest statements, and newlines instead of semicolons to separate them. 
                All our examples are available in both syntaxes. -->
            <ul><code>.scss</code> - most common</ul> 
            <ul><code>.sass</code> - more unusual, indented syntax</ul>
            SASS <b>CANNOT</b> be read/understood by browsers
            To make this work, you must compile sass into css by using this command: 
            <pre>
                <code>
                    sass --watch input.scss output.css
                </code>
            </pre>
            <h2>Partials</h2>
            <p>
                "partial" sass files contain:
                <ul> Little snippets of CSS which can be included in other Sass files </ul>
                <ul> Modularize your CSS, keeping things easier to maintain</ul>
                <ul> Named with a leading underscore </ul>
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        _partial.scss
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <!--Basically like functions. Code a css snippet in a partial and then you can reference that partial in the main css file.-->
            </p>
            <h2>Variables</h2>
            <p>
            Sass allows for the use of variables, which can reference colors, numbers, strings, etc. </p>
            <ul>Use the $ to declare and reference a variable</ul>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    $logo-color: #ff00bb
                </code>

                ...which can then be referenced as:

                <code>
                    button {
                        background: $logo-color;
                    }

                    h2 {
                        color: $logo-color;
                    }
                </code>
            </pre>
            <ul>Imperative: </ul>
            <ul><li>Sass variables are imperative, which means if you use a variable and then change its value, the earlier use will stay the same.</li></ul>
            <ul><li>CSS variables are declarative, which means if you change the value, it’ll affect both earlier uses and later uses.</li></ul>
            <ul>Variables that are defined by a built-in module cannot be modified.</ul>
            </p>
            <h3>Example of variable use:</h3>
            <div class="btn-group">
                <div class="firstFlop">
                    <button>Normal CSS 1</button>
                </div>
    
                <div class="secondFlop">
                    <button>Normal CSS 2</button>

        <div>
            <h1 id="Interpolation">Interpolation </h1>
            <p>
                Interpolation can be used almost anywhere in a Sass stylesheet to embed the result of a SassScript expression into a chunk of CSS. 
                Just wrap an expression in #{} in any of the following places:
            </p>
            <h2>SassScript</h2>
            <p>
                Interpolation can be used in SassScript to inject SassScript into unquoted strings.
                This is particularly useful when dynamically generating names (for example for animations), or when using slash-separated values.
                Note that interpolation in SassScript always returns an unquoted string.
            </p>
            <h2>Quoted Strings</h2>
            <p>
                In most cases, interpolation injects the exact same text that would be used if the expression were used as a property value.
                But there is one exception: the quotation marks around quoted strings are removed (even if those quoted strings are in lists). 
                This makes it possible to write quoted strings that contain syntax that’s not allowed in SassScript (like selectors) and interpolate them into style rules.
            </p>
        </div> <!-- end interpolation -->

            <h2>@MIXIN</h2>
                <ul>CSS Classes with similar styles?</ul>
                <ul>Create one MIXIN class that can be mentioned in other classes!</ul>
            <h2>@INCLUDE</h2>
                <ul>Allows user to include mixins in classes</ul>
            <h2>@IMPORT</h2>
                <ul>Extends the CSS at-rule to load styles, mixins, functions, and variables from other stylesheets</ul>
                <ul>Similar to @import in Java</ul>
            <h2>@USE</h2>
                <ul>Newer version of @import</ul>
                <ul>Only imports desired module ONCE</ul>
                <ul>Allows user to keep track of variables</ul> 
            <h2>@FORWARD</h2>
                <ul>Can be used prior to @use</ul>
                <ul>"Forwards" mixins, functions, and variables from a stylesheet that are included in another stylesheet</ul>
            <h2>@FUNCTION</h2>
                @function defines custom functions that can be used in SassScript expressions.
                <!-- Rounded switch -->
                <!-- <label class="switch">
                    <input type="checkbox">

            <h2>@EXTEND</h2>
                <ul>Allows selectors to inherit styles from one another</ul>
            <h2>@AT-ROOT</h2>
                @at-root puts styles within it at the root of the CSS document.
            <h2>@ERROR</h2>
                @error causes compilation to fail with an error message.
            <h2>@WARN</h2>
                @warn prints a warning without stopping compilation entirely.
            <h2>@DEBUG</h2>
                @debug prints a message for debugging purposes.
            <h2>Flow Control</h2>
                Flow control rules like @if, @each, @for, and @while control whether or how many times styles are emitted.
            <table>
                <th>@if controls whether or not a block is evaluated.</th>
                <th>@each evaluates a block for each element in a list or each pair in a map.</th>
                <th>@for evaluates a block a certain number of times.</th>
                <th>@while evaluates a block until a certain condition is met.</th>

        <div>
            <h1 id="Operators">Operators</h1>
            <p> 	
                Sass supports a handful of useful operators for working with different values.
                These include the standard mathematical operators like + and *, as well as operators for various other types:
                <li>== and != are used to check if two values are the same.</li>
                <li>+, -, *, /, and % have their usual mathematical meaning for numbers, with special behaviors for units that matches the use of units in scientific math.</li>
                <li><, <=, >, and >= check whether two numbers are greater or less than one another.</li>
                <li>and, or, and not have the usual boolean behavior. Sass considers every value “true” except for false and null.</li>
                <li>+, -, and / can be used to concatenate strings.</li>
            </p>
        </div> <!-- end operators -->

        <div>
            <h1 id="Modules">Modules</h1>
            <p>
                Sass provides many built-in modules which contain useful functions (and the occasional mixin).
                These modules can be loaded with the @use rule like any user-defined stylesheet, 
                and their functions can be called like any other module member. 
                All built-in module URLs begin with sass: to indicate that they're part of Sass itself.
            </p>
            Sass provides the following built-in modules:
            <li>The sass:math module provides functions that operate on numbers.</li>
            <li>The sass:string module makes it easy to combine, search, or split apart strings.</li>
            <li>The sass:color module generates new colors based on existing ones, making it easy to build color themes.</li>
            <li>The sass:list module lets you access and modify values in lists.</li>
            <li>The sass:map module makes it possible to look up the value associated with a key in a map, and much more.</li>
            <li>The sass:selector module provides access to Sass’s powerful selector engine.</li>
            <li>The sass:meta module exposes the details of Sass’s inner workings.</li>
        </div> <!-- end modules -->
