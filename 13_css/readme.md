DISCO:
* ```color``` - text color
* ```background``` - color of the box surrounding element
* ```display: flex``` - allows multiple elements to be side-by-side
* ```text-align``` - works like align in word processors
* You can nest ```div```
* Can style ```<html>```

QCC:
* Why does ```width``` for ```navbar``` need to be an absurdly high number (```700px```) to look right?
