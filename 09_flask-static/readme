DEMO 
basics of /static folder

DISCO:
- when running http://localhost:5000/static/foo, the browser prompts you 
to 
download the file foo. 
- when running http://localhost:5000/static/foo.html, you get brought to 
a site that prints the text in the body: "Is this plaintext, though?" as 
opposed to 
"No hablo queso" when running app.py.
- when u run app.py, it prints to the terminal:
    the __name__ of this module is...
    __main__

QCC:
- then what...?
