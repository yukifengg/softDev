      <p style="font-size: 19px; width: 75%;">
        Ben is a gift to me from my cousin. An avid boba lover, she knew I loved all things food and wanted to 
        showcase our common interests in a physical form. She lives in San Francisco and I see her maybe twice a 
        year, so Ben the boba plushie makes up for the distance and time. He's adorable!

      <h3 style="font-weight: 700;">The Coming Of</h3>
      <p style="font-size: 19px; width: 75%;">
        When god presented this to me I didn't know what to say. I was speechless, touched by the consideration 
        of the nameless god, and even more so by the present itself. It was a plushie. Garnered with a deep, ocean blue coloration
        and a white underbelly as pure as the very thing that made it. It looked at itself with curious blue eyes
        : A forked tail, two fins, and a long curved body.
      </p>
      <h3 style="font-weight: 700;">The Questioning</h3>
      <div class = "grid-x">
        <div class = "cell small-5">
          <p style="font-size: 19px; width: 75%; display: inline-flex; padding-bottom: 25px;">
            It declared first with confidence, 'Of Course, I must be a Dolphin'
          </p>

          <p style="font-size: 19px; width: 100%; display: inline-flex;">
            But then the plush noticed, the sharp inner rows of teeth lining its mouth, the menacing fin stuck out of its back.
            'But Of Course'. It was obvious now, the plush was a Shark! 
          </p>

        <p style="font-size: 19px; width: 60%; display: inline-flex;">
          But then It began to question. What really was it? the question weighed down on the plush. 
          It felt suffocated, trapped by the walls of fate. How was it to live as a shark knowing 
          that it might be a dolphin? Suddenly, the teeth laid inside of the plush's mouth felt much smaller,
          less sharp than before. Was this just a trick of the mind? Or was it something much more sinister?
          Was someone maniuplating its teeth? Or perhaps the plush was able to change the shape of its chompers 
          at will? To be Continued . . .
