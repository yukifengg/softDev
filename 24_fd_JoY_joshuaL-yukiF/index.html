  Hi peeps!

<p class="lead callout success text-center">Paragraphs have a whole new design! They're formatted to make text look nicers while being robust when you change screen size. <br>
    You can do a whole bunch of stuff when styling your paragraphs by using certain keywords in your tag. <br>For example: <code>class="callout large primary text-center"</code>
      </p>
      
<h3 class = "callout primary">Basics!</h3>
      <ul>
          <li>callout &lt;INSERT WORD HERE&gt; is a convenient container to style headings and paragraphs</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Colors</li>
              <ul>
              <li>Primary (Blue)</li> <li>Secondary (Grey)</li> <li>Success (Green)</li> <li>Alert (Red)</li> <li>Warning (Yellow)</li>
              </ul>
            <li>Padding Size</li>
              <ul>
              <li>small</li> <li>medium</li> <li>large</li>
              </ul>
          </ul>
      </ul>

      You can use the 'button' class to make your links look pretty! <br><strong class = "callout warning small">WARNING BUTTON'S ARE NOT FOR FORM SUBMISSIONS</strong>

      <p class = "lead">What you see above you are two cool functions of Foundation. Using the grid class, you can make grids (duh!). Inside the grid are two cells, which are cards. We like grids because it helps make laying out your info easy (YAY!) We like cards because adding a picture with a caption is pretty common for websites, and cards make things look dope!</p>
   
      
      <p>This is pretty much the most basic low-down you can get. Once you're used to using the classes and whatnot, feel free to traverse the documentation linked in the button above!</p>
