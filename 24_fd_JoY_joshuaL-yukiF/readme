24 - Foundation
Time Spent: 2

DISCO:
    Grid is cool in Foundation. Makes it easy to put things side by side
    Can easily align text to wherever you want in the element

QCC:

q0: 1  
q0b: Neighboring team's readme:  
    "can access Foundation's css via formal linkage method ```<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/foundation-sites@6.7.5/dist/css/foundation.min.css" crossorigin="anonymous">```"  
    "add callout for optimal costimization ```<div class = callout primary large>```"  

q1: (JL) I like the Bootstrap framework more because it has more features, albeit more complicated to use than  
    Foundation is. Foundation doesn't seem to have anything about positioning of elements of padding/margins.
